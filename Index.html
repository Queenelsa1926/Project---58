    <h3> ~Dancing~ </h3>



    <h4> Hi my hobby is to dance because when i hear the music i want to dance because it kind of helps me freshen my mind!I am 10 years old and am moving into 5th grade, whenever i have free time i put on music and start dancing however i want, dancing makes you feel free and you can do however you want to dance. you can not say you are not dancing, any movement is a type of dance! so if some one is doing a basic movement, thats still a type of dancing! so that is why i love dancing and thats why its my hobby. </h4>
